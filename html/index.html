        <h3>The Creator</h3>

        <p>
            I started drawing as a way to help express myself as well as assist with others who may not be able to create what they envision.
             I strive to always make my clients happy so that I may share my talent with more people in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I love doing commissions, they're not my full-time activity. I also put my art skills towards creating videogames
             or designs that support my literature.
