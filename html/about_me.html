        <h3>About the Creator</h3>
        <br />
        <p>My name is Amir! Some call me Sylk online as he is my persona/mascot for my business!</p>


        <p>
            More information about me and why you should consider comissioning me!
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
            I am a freelance artist who tends to have lower prices for any who wish to get high-quality pieces.
             Since this is my hobby I tend to lower the prices compared to my competition. If I worked full-time
              as and artist I probably would raise the amount per hour. :)
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are looking to get your characters drawn whether for a book or just for fun, my art may be for you!
             I specialize mainly in character designing! I've done work for many fellow artists as well as streamers 
             that need a new mascot!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are looking to go into the career of streaming partial or full-time then you also will be glad to hear
             I do a lot of work with professional streamers! Ranging from setting up their profiles with pictures, but also 
             giving virtual mascots (v-tubers) a model to show on stream instead of their face!
        </p>
        <p>
            I can even do thumbnails for videos if needed!
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
            Another reason why you would want to support me is that I am heavily against using AI in the art industry! 
            A lot of clients are always worried that they aren't getting authentic work, but with my services you will 
            never be handed anything less than pure human-made art! Passion and all!
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
            You can find examples of my work for streaming and character designs in the navigation menu! Feel free to check 
            those out and see if you like my style!

        <h3>The Creator</h3>

        <p>
            I started drawing as a way to help express myself as well as assist with others who may not be able to create what they envision.
             I strive to always make my clients happy so that I may share my talent with more people in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I love doing commissions, they're not my full-time activity. I also put my art skills towards creating videogames
             or designs that support my literature.
        </p>
